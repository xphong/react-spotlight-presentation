							<li>Testing the data layer with UI</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Unit tests do have one major disadvantage: even if the units work well in isolation, you do not know if they work well together. For that, you can use an integration test. An integration test takes a small group of units, often two units, and tests their behavior as a whole, verifying that they coherently work together.

						<p>
							GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ask for what you need, get exactly that
						</p>
						<p>
							Send a GraphQL query to your API and get exactly what you need, nothing more and nothing less. GraphQL queries always return predictable results. Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not the server.

							The babel-preset-es20XX (15, 16, 17) presets include transforms needed to convert features added in that specific year to code that is compatible with the previous version.

							babel-preset-env includes transforms for all features that have landed in the spec, but only enables the ones needed to make the features work based on the set of environments you've provided to it. If you pass no options to env it essentially works like es2015, es2016, es2017 all together.

					<h3>Tree Shaking</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Tree shaking or dead code elimination means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process.
						</p>
						<p>
							Utilizing the tree shaking and dead code elimination can significantly reduce the code size we have in our application. The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be.

					<h3>Code Splitting</h3>
					<div>
						<ul>
							<li>Process of taking one large bundle containing your entire app, and splitting them up into multiple smaller bundles which contain separate parts of your app.</li>
							<li>Route-based splitting vs. Component-based splitting</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. It can be used to achieve smaller bundles and control resource load prioritization which, if used correctly, can have a major impact on load time.

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The idea behind bundle splitting is pretty simple. If you have one giant file, and change one line of code, the user must download that entire file again. But if you’d split it into two files, then the user would only need to download the one that changed, and the browser would serve the other file from cache.</p>
						<p>
							With bundle splitting, you can push the vendor dependencies to a bundle of their own and benefit from client level caching. The process can be done in such a way that the whole size of the application remains the same. Given there are more requests to perform, there's a slight overhead. But the benefit of caching makes up for this cost.

To give you a quick example, instead of having main.js (100 kB), you could end up with main.js (10 kB) and vendor.js (90 kB). Now changes made to the application are cheap for the clients that have already used the application earlier.

							So you’ve decided to build your product by reusing code. This has practice challenges. The first problem of shared code is dependencies, ideally there should be an automatic way to get all dependencies at once. In the past we've either copied-pasted or manually downloaded files from jQuery and Bootstrap. The second problem is theme styles located in different places in the code base unnecessarily coupling the different dependencies. This leads to having to include more and more code bases in order to achieve the needed functionality, causing code bloat. In addition, A GUI component should have a single custom element interface so the user doesn’t have to copy and paste markup into their files. A component should leverage a package manager to handle component dependencies.

Keep in mind that package managers can have bugs, version conflicts and other complications however. The packages should follow semantic versioning (semver), allowing you easily know if installing the updated component will break your build. For semver version X.Y.Z, X is a major breaking change, Y is a minor non-breaking (backward compatible) change, and Z are patches. A major change signals that you will need to update your own app code. Ideally the package manager will also manage version conflicts, downloading supported dependency versions only. NPM and Bower diverge on how this is handled. With NPM we download multiple versions of a package when requested and simply nest them in the package folder, while Bower requires you to manually manage conflicts. This is by design, since Bower was a more front-end focus and the front end has a single global namespace making multiple versions problematic.

Create your own package

If you have a public github repo with the required manifest files you can include then as NPM packages. You can also setup private packages. The best way to do that is to set up a private registry, which is how your package will be located.
